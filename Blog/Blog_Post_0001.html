            I decided to learn to code for fun in mid January of this year.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I started by finding a super-duper beginner friendly project 
            <a href="https://devpractical.com/create-a-web-page-using-html/">
                here
            </a>
             and used that as a guide to make my first
            <a href="C:\Users\15093\Documents\Code Learning\Practice Pages\Firstwebpageproject.html">
                practice page
            </a>
             on January 18th-ish.
       
            I made three more practice pages that day. The next day I stumbled across 
            <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">
                Frontend Mentor
            </a>
            and, consequently,
            <a href="https://github.com/">
                GitHub.
            </a>
      
            I thought they were probably scams set up to steal my identity and download viruses onto my computer.
 
            They weren't, so I set myself a new goal of completing the Frontend Mentor
            <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/getting-started-on-frontend-mentor-XJhRWRREZd/steps/66a96145e2150da4c46f315f/challenge/start">
                QR code component challenge.
            </a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I worked toward that for, like, half a week, and then I met this guy named Peter and lost focus for a bit.

            It turns out Peter is great, but we've been together for six months now and ADHD brain is circling back around to coding.

            I picked back up with 
                <a href="C:\Users\15093\Documents\Code Learning\Practice Pages\Practice_Page_Nine.html">
                    Practice Page Nine
                </a>
             yesterday, but I feel like those couple of weeks I spent in January are probably enough HTML to start with, so I moved on to learning CSS.

            For posterity, this screenshot of my homepage at the moment shows where my CSS skills are as of this writing:
