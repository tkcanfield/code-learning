    <p>
      This is my fourth practice page. I got stuck at "Doctype."

      Notes on this round:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm remembering how to do more of this!
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm sure I will have to re-learn it all tomorrow.
      </li>
      <li>
        But tomorrow it will come faster, I bet!
      </li>
      <li>
        So far I have only had to look up the boiler plate code, but I also haven't looked to see if what I'm doing translates to web viewing...
      </li>
      <li>
        Looked up how to add an image.
      </li>
      <li>
        Looked up how to add a link.
      <li>
        Forgot to put the "title" bit in the heading, so "fourth practice page" appeared twice.
      </li>
    </ul>
