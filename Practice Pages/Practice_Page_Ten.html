            Let's see if I can style this with an external stylesheet...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="date">08/01/2024</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            So far, I have not been able to style this with my external stylesheet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This bit I'm going to try to make be GREEN.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ok. That took longer than seems necessary.
                <ul>
                    <li>Originally included the style element on the css page. No bueno.</li>
                    <li>Too many quotes around the link in the HTML page. Also no bueno.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let's bring back that cheat sheet from PP9:</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's see if I can make h3 purple...
                <ul>
                    <li>Excellent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Now I'm learning how to assign universal properties, like fonts for the whole page!
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href=https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html>W3 reference page</a> 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cool. As of 11:13 am, this entire page has text displaying as Arial.</li>
            <li>EXTRA cool: Visual Studio Code will offer me suggestions when I don't have the right vocabulary. So now h1 is aligned center!</li>
            <li>Lots of things can have the same class, and things can have lots of classes. Not so much with IDs.
                <ul>
                    <li>Classes are poly; IDs are exclusive.</li>
                    <li>Both are fine.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>id > class > type.</li>
            <li>according to Codecademy, if I set a rule for a class, anything with that class attribute (is attribute the right word?) should be styled according to that rule, even if in general they're different.
                <ul>
                    <li> for example, even though h3 is styled purple in my CSS practice sheet, anything classed as a date should be showing up dark blue.</li>
                    <li>(It's not.)</li>
                    <li>(Wait... now it is. I think I forgot to refresh. Silly.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="menu">I think I was wrong about ids: It seems that multiple things CAN have the same id...</li>
            <li>Also, I don't understand why removing the id from the div but leaving it on the a doesn't keep a's text alignment right, if that's the id rule?
                <ul>
                    <li>See screenshot:</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
